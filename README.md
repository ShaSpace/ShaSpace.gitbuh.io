This repository supports the files for my website/portfolio. Each html file is a different page of the website, and they each reference functions found in the styles file.
The styles file is where the formatting happens. 
The assets folder contains all the images, videos, and other media that can be found throughout the site. 

Right now it's just me, Sha'Lynn, working on this website day by day to get it up and running.
